<p>This Project is a Discord Bot that allows users to type commands </p>

<p> Commands</p>
<ul>
<li> /Weathertoday </li>
<li> /Weathertonight </li>
<li> /Weathertomorrow</li>
</ul>

<p>I created a discord bot that finds out the weather forecast in Rock Hill, South Carolina. This was inspired by an assigment I worked on in my Javascript course during my time at Winthrop. A user can ask the bot the weather for tonight, tomorrow and today. Once asked, the bot will give full description of what the forecast will look like. </p>
